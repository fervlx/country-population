# country-population
This Python project uses the Matplotlib library to display population graphs by country. The main goal of the project is to provide a visual and easy-to-understand way of how the population has changed in different countries over time.

The code is based on data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), and uses CSV files to load the data. Data can be filtered by country and the range of years desired for visualization.

To run the project, Python 3 and the Matplotlib library installed on the system are required. Additionally, a basic understanding of Python and data visualization is recommended.
